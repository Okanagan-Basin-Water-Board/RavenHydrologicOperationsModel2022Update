#Metadata for Raven Okanagan Operations Model
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#ABSTRACT:
This model was developed for the OBWB by NHC to support floodplain mapping completed in 2020 (NHC, 2020).
The model covers the mainstem of the Okanagan River and it's tributaries including current operations. 
The model structure is a modified HBV-EC model. The model was calibrated for peak flows. Additional detail on calibration can be found in the Chapter 3 of the supporting report (NHC, 2020). 
The model can be run in two different modes: 
1. Standard regulation scenario - the regular mode considers current regulation on the mainstem 
2. Open gate scenario - simulates the gates of Okanagan and Skaha Lake dam as fully open with resservoir outflow dictated by rating curves. The rvt file for the open gates scenario is named Okanagan_opengates.rvt

#ORGANIZATION:
The model was developed by Northwest Hydraulic Consultants Ltd.

#MODEL EXECUTABLE:
The model was developed to run on Raven v2.9.2

#SPATIAL COVERAGE:
The model includes 64 subbasins that cover the mainstem of the Okanagan River, ending at Osoyoos Lake

#TEMPORAL COVERAGE:
The model can run on historical climate data from 1945-2012 (see climate data) as well as future projections to 2100
