#Metadata for Raven Okanagan Operations Model
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#ABSTRACT:
This model is an update of the original Okanagan mainstem operations model developed by NHC in 2020 to support floodplain mapping (NHC, 2020).
The model has been updated to run on Version 3.5 of Raven. 
The model now includes withdrawls as well as recalibration to better support low flow operations (not only peak flow operations) downstream of Lake Okanagan. 

#ORGANIZATION:
The model was developed by Northwest Hydraulic Consultants Ltd.

#DATE:
November 2022

#MODEL EXECUTABLE:
The model was developed to run on Raven v3.5. The model runs on v3.6 as well but no checks were performed to ensure outputs have not changed. The user is cautioned to make these checks themselves prior to using 
newer executables. 

#SPATIAL COVERAGE:
The model includes 64 subbasins that cover the mainstem of the Okanagan River, ending at Osoyoos Lake

#TEMPORAL COVERAGE:
The model can run on historical climate data from 1945-2012 (see climate data) as well as future projections to 2100
